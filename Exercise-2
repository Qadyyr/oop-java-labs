# Exercise 2: Mathematical Expressions

## Problem Statement

Write Java code to identify if the given input by the user is even or odd.

## Requirements

- Take an integer input from the user
- Determine if the number is even or odd
- Display the result

## Concepts Used

- Scanner class for input
- Modulo operator (%)
- if-else statements

## Expected Output

```
Enter any number to check whether it is even or odd: 
15
15 is Odd
```

OR

```
Enter any number to check whether it is even or odd: 
20
20 is Even
```

## Logic

- A number is even if `number % 2 == 0`
- A number is odd if `number % 2 != 0`
