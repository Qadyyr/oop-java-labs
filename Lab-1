# Lab 1: Introduction to Java Programming

## Objectives

1. What is JAVA?
2. Features of Java
3. JAVA Basics
4. Installing JDK and setting path
5. Writing HelloWorld.java in Text Editor
6. JAVA variables & data types
7. Input & Output
8. Java Variable Type Conversion & Type Casting
9. Lab tasks
10. Post Lab Questions

## Prerequisites

Basic understanding of programming concepts and ability to install software.

## Lab Structure

Each exercise is organized in its own directory with:
- `README.md` - Problem statement and requirements
- Solution Java file(s) - Working implementation

### Exercises

1. **[Exercise 1: JAVA Environment Installation & Error Messages](./exercise1/)** - Setup and understanding compiler errors
2. **[Exercise 2: Mathematical Expressions](./exercise2/)** - Even/odd number checker
3. **[Exercise 3: Type Casting](./exercise3/)** - Division with type conversion
4. **[Exercise 4: Operators](./exercise4/)** - Finding largest of three numbers
5. **[Exercise 5: if/else, Array](./exercise5/)** - Array operations (largest, search, count evens, reverse)
6. **[Exercise 6: Debugging Practice](./exercise6/)** - Finding and fixing common Java errors

## Key Concepts Covered

- **Java Environment Setup**: Installing JDK and understanding the compilation process
- **Data Types**: int, double, String, boolean, arrays
- **Input/Output**: Using Scanner class for user input
- **Operators**: Arithmetic, relational, and logical operators
- **Control Structures**: if-else statements, for loops
- **Arrays**: Declaration, initialization, and manipulation
- **Type Casting**: Converting between data types
- **Error Handling**: Understanding and fixing common compilation errors

## How to Use

1. Navigate to any exercise directory:
   ```bash
   cd exercise2
   ```

2. Compile and run the Java file:
   ```bash
   javac Main.java
   java Main
   ```

## Post Lab Questions

1. Can you cast string into int?
2. Why JAVA when there are other OOP languages?

## Notes

- All exercises use static methods only (object-oriented concepts come in later labs)
- Scanner class is used for user input
- Remember to import `java.util.Scanner` when using Scanner
